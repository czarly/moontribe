Hello World.
=========================


Hey friendly human. Nice to see you. Can you help us?

We are a decentralized company. We are few but we are growing rapidly. Today is day 1 and we refer to us as the moon tribe. One day we will fly to space together and will do everything that we can to get there. We will build a spaceship and curiosity will guide our way. If you still need a tribe and want to take part, don't be shy to reach out.

You can find things that we are working or playing with right now in our public Trello board. If you want to add something you are working on, just ask us to be added to the list of editors. You can drop us a email at [somethingwithmoon@gmail.com](mailto:somethingwithmoon@gmail.com) now!

Find us every day following the [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=somethingwithmoon%40gmail.com&ctz=Asia%2FSaigon). 

You can edit this website and issue a pull request to update. 


I like you.
